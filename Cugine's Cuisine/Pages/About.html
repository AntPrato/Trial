	<h2>About</h2>
  <h3>Cugine's Cuisine was founded in 2022 by Anthony Prato, of Staten Island, New York. Anthony has worked as a restaurant owner and head chef for many years, and he can't wait to bring his knowledge and skills to your plates. As you could see below,my wife, mother, and I work diligently to bring you the food we dearly love. Our goal is to bring you the food that we grew up on, down to the last ingredient. Nestled in southern Brooklyn, we want to make sure we are not only feeding the people of the five boroughs of New York City, but everyone in the world. At Cugine Cuisine's, we are all family. We hope to see you soon!</h3>
