  <h3>Cugine's Cuisine was founded in 2022 by Anthony Prato, of Staten Island, New York. Anthony has worked as a restaurant owner and head chef for many years, and he can't wait to bring his knowledge and skills to your plates. As you could see below, Anthony's wife, mother, work diligently along with him to bring you the food they dearly love. Their goal is to bring you the food that they grew up on, down to the last ingredient. Nestled in southern Brooklyn, they want to make sure they are not only feeding the people of the five boroughs of New York City, but everyone in the world. At Cugine Cuisine's, we are all family. We hope to see you soon!</h3>
